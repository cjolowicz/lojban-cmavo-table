## Lojban cmavo tables

Here is a colour coded, interactive table of cmavo, the structure
words of the language Lojban. Try hovering over and clicking on any
cmavo or selma'o in the table.

If the page does not fit on your screen, try using the zoom facility
of your browser (the tables are floating). You'll need JavaScript for
the &ldquo;clickability&rdquo;. Sorry, no cross-browser testing, it
was developed with Firefox.

Some cmavo are omitted from the table to make it more compact: All
cmavo in *Y* and *BY2*, which are all those containing
the letter &lsquo;y&rsquo;, as well as those cmavo in *UI* with
diphtonghs other than &ldquo;ai, au, ei, oi.&rdquo;

The cmavo are arranged alphabetically in rows and columns. Cmavo
belonging to the same selma'o have the same colour. If you click on a
selma'o below the table, all cmavo of that selma'o are highlighted. If
you click on a cmavo, other cmavo of the same selma'o are
highlighted. If you hover over a cmavo, an English gloss appears in a
tooltip.

The cmavo table was generated by a Python script.
